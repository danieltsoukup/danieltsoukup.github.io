    I'm a data scientist at <a href="https://mostly.ai/" target="_blank">Mostly AI</a>, currently working on problems in data privacy and
	building new generative models that produce the safest and most accurate synthetic data from complex data sources. I am experienced in various machine learning and deep learning frameworks, 
    NLP methodology and have plenty of coding under my belt in Python.

    I did my PhD at the University of Toronto and my following research was centred around understanding  large, seemingly random and chaotic abstract mathematical objects. How do local and global properties of cenrtain structures interact and affect each other? Can a large network be sparse and highly connected at the same time? I have been focusing on such questions in graph theory, logic and combinatorics.
    
    <br>
    <br>
    
    I am also passionate about teaching, active learning methods and I recently dabbled in high-school outreach and criptography.
