           <li><b>August 2019</b>: I was working with the Uniqa Data Science team on an exciting text classification project. We researched the NLP literature on long document classifiation and  experimented with various word-embeddings and combined CNN/LSTM architectures. By the end of September, I hope to have a write-up of our results.

MS Azure, Tensorflow, Keras, here we go!

I finished my PhD in 2015 at
the Mathematics Department of the University of Toronto. Currently, I am
working at the Kurt Gödel Research Center in Mathematical Logic
(Universität Wien) as a postdoc researcher.

<br />
<br />

<!--
In my research, I study problems that lie on the border of finite and infinite combinatorics, and logic, with a focus on chromatic number and Ramsey-type problems in graph theory and independence results in logic and set theory.
<br>
<br />
-->

    My research at the University of Vienna is centred around understanding  large, seemingly random and chaotic abstract mathematical objects by looking at the collection of well-behaving substructures. How do local and global properties of these structures interact and affect each other? I have been focusing on these questions in graph theory, logic and combinatorics in general.

    Imagine a giant network that we know is dense by some measure (my work revolves around the chromatic number as a global measure). It is known that locally, this density is not necessarily detectable. However, are there always large highly connected clusters? In my PhD thesis, I answered an old question of Erdős and Hajnal by showing that there could be graphs with uncountable chromatic number but with no infinitely connected, uncountable subgraphs.
    
    <br>
    <br>
    
    My work is motivated by still open classical problems, as well as recent research by Komjáth, Thomasse, Thomassen, Shelah and Todorcevic among others. Hopefully you'll find the most important academic informations about me on this website. Feel free to contact me in case you got interested in any of the things I work with.
<br>
<br />
    
    I am also passionate about teaching, active learning methods and I recently dabbled in high-school outreach and criptography.
